This project is the Libary component of the JsonTranform Solution.  It house a single service and its interface.  The service contains all the functions and procedures that transform a JsonElement to a specified template string.
The code requires that the Template has a the **<template-row>** start tags and the **</template-row>** tag and field position are indicated by **<field-__fieldname__>** tag without any closing tag.

The API require both the template parameter and a JSON array in order to work properly. Otherwise respose will show error messages.  Please check the swagger for further information.
